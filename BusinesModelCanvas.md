# COVID-Project

## Creating an COVID-19 webpage project through data and analytics.

### Key partners:
1.The University faculty/staff

2.The students of the university

3.School board

### Key activites partners perform:
1. Faculty and students would use the covid checker to better track data.
2. University admin would use the data to make better decisions for university policies and actions.

### Key activities:
1.Answering the covid checker survey.

### Distribution channels:
1. Email/university website.

### Key Resources:
1. The University website
2. The covid checker site.

#### Types of resources:
1. The data obtained by the site.

### Value Propositon:
1. The university does not currently monitor the numbers of covid at the university and this checker would help the university monitor the numbers and adjust
the university policy on covid to help with mitigation.
2. This would help put students and staff at the university at ease, helping them know the numbers more.

### Customer Relationships:
1. This checker is a self-service type of application where the user enters their own data into it.
2. This would be a community of just the univeristy/I.T. program.

### Channels:
1. A Univerity website
2. A reminder sent out throgh point park email.

### Channel Phases: 
1. Awareness: Sending out emails to students and staff about the new covid checker
2. Evaluation: Send out a feedback form to students and staff. We could also send out any updates with changes we made to the checker and send out updates
  on the number of cases reported.
3. After Sales: Have an F&Q section on the website

### Customer Segments:
1. the University as a whole but really the students as it would make them feel safer knowing how many cases are on the university.

### Cost Structure:
1. Time is really the only cost to us now
2. If this was real we would have more resources available to us, so we would have to pay maybe for advertising costs.
3. Cost of data storage

### Revenue Stream: (Would be more of a non-profit project)
1. Ads
2. Sponsors
3. Possible built in university fees.

### Survey Checker (PPU Covid-Checker)
1. Added question related to COVID-19
2. Academic Type will distinguish which university member is a student, faculty, and staff member
3. Will provide later insight of data collected and presented to the User's (Point Park academic members)
